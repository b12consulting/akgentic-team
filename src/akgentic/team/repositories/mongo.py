    (``{"metadata_indexes": 1}``) on the ``teams`` collection. Every name is
    load-bearing: deployment tooling probes for literal index names — the
    enterprise orphan reconciler waits on ``teams_status_idx`` and stays
    fail-closed while it is absent — so a rename leaves those sweeps silently
    suspended with no error anywhere.

    ``teams_metadata_indexes_idx`` is a **multikey** index. That is not a
    distinct index type to request: MongoDB derives it automatically from an
    array-valued field, storing one entry per array element, which is exactly
    what the anchored ``$regex`` terms in :meth:`MongoEventStore.list_teams`
    seek on. Hence a plain single-field ascending spec here and no option to
    pass (ADR-24 §D5). The name and key spec are unchanged by the move from
    equality to prefix — deployment tooling probes for the literal name.

    Idempotent — ``create_index`` returns silently when an index of the same
    name and key spec already exists, so this is safe across redeploys and safe
    to call from a constructor, an init container or a migration job alike. It
    is guarded per index: a backend that rejects a spec is logged at WARNING and
    skipped, never raised, and a rejection of one index does not skip the
    others — which is why the ``try`` sits inside the loop rather than around
    it. An index is an optimization; refusing to start is the worse outcome
    (ADR-16 §5, ADR-23 §5, ADR-24 §D5).

    This covers the **teams** collection only. The ``events`` and
    ``agent_states`` indexes stay in :meth:`MongoEventStore.__init__` and are
    not affected by ``MONGO_TEAM_AUTO_INDEX``.

        All three filters are pushed into the same Mongo ``find`` filter dict
        — ``{"user_id": ...}``, ``{"status": ...}`` and, per filtered metadata
        key, one ``$or`` of anchored ``{"metadata_indexes": {"$regex": "^..."}}``
        arms, those ``$or`` groups collected under ``$and``. A parameter left at
        ``None`` contributes no key, so ``list_teams()`` issues ``find({})`` and
        returns every team. The selection happens in MongoDB, never in Python
        after hydration, so a team that will not be returned is never
        transferred or validated.

        The ``$or``-inside-``$and`` nesting **is** the combination rule: terms
        for one key OR, distinct keys AND (ADR-28 §D7). The outer ``$and`` is
        also what keeps two keys apart at all, since a single dict cannot carry
        two ``metadata_indexes`` keys.

        The regex is **anchored and case-sensitive**, deliberately: ``$options:
        "i"`` disables index use entirely, which is precisely why
        :func:`~akgentic.team.metadata.make_index_entry` casefolds the value
        half on write instead (ADR-28 §D2). Neither ``$and: []`` nor ``$or: []``
        is ever emitted — MongoDB rejects both — because a key that renders no
        term yields no group at all.

        The indexes (``teams_user_id_idx``, ``teams_status_idx`` and the
        multikey ``teams_metadata_indexes_idx``, all provisioned by
        :func:`ensure_indexes`) only make the scan cheaper — an unindexed
        filter still returns the right teams, which is what makes the
        ``auto_create_indexes`` opt-out safe. Corrupted documents are skipped
        with a warning. See ADR-16 §5, ADR-23 §§5-6 and ADR-24 §D5.

        ``user_id`` is applied server-side unconditionally of the other two:
        it is a trust boundary, not an optimization, and a metadata term is
        caller-supplied and non-secret. Narrowing by metadata must never
        become a way to reach another user's teams (ADR-24 §D5).

            user_id: If provided, return only snapshots whose
                ``Process.user_id`` matches. If ``None`` (default), the

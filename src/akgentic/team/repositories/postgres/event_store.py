"""Nagra-backed ``EventStore`` implementation.

Implements the nine :class:`~akgentic.team.ports.EventStore` Protocol methods
against PostgreSQL using Nagra's :class:`~nagra.Transaction` wrapper. Each
public method opens its own transaction (per-method ownership);
:meth:`NagraEventStore.delete_team` is the one exception that spans a single
transaction across three ``DELETE`` statements for atomic cascade semantics.

The class satisfies the ``EventStore`` Protocol via structural subtyping — it
does NOT inherit from the Protocol explicitly (mirrors ``YamlEventStore`` and
``MongoEventStore``).

Implements ADR-15 Nagra-based PostgreSQL EventStore §§2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10.

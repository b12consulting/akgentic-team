        therefore tolerate a dead sender -- see the ``addr_map`` gate below.

        (ADR-020 §3). Subscribers are attached by now (phase 2g), so this reaches
        the stream; the orchestrator fans it out without appending to the event
        log, and the caller's ``restoring=True`` guard keeps it out of the
